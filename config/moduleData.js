            intro: "Congrats! You just received your first paycheck after working hard for 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month! Now you have all this money that you didn’t have before… What should you do with it? When your boss or manager hands you your paycheck, the first thing you need to do is know how to read and understand it correctly. Depending on your occupation and circumstance, you may receive a physical or online pay stub. See below to watch a quick video on understanding your paystub.",

                "Now that you know how much money you have earned, you may be unsure of where to put this money. Should you just leave your paycheck on your desk? When your employer gives you money, the money probably goes into your <span class=\"vocab tooltipped\" data-position=\"top\" data-tooltip=\"An account you can easily deposit and withdraw from to make everyday purchases\">checking account</span>. To access this money you can use an <span class=\"vocab tooltipped\" data-position=\"top\" data-tooltip=\"Automated Teller Machine\">ATM</span>, debit card, or your own checkbook. But in general, only the money you need for daily necessities should be in your checking account… so not all the money you earned should be stored in there. Why does this matter, you may ask? If you look from a futuristic point of view and you want to save up money efficiently, only storing your money in a checking account is not going to that! Checking accounts usually don’t earn much (or any) <span class=\"vocab tooltipped\" data-position=\"top\" data-tooltip=\"Payment for privilege of borrowing/storing money, expressed as Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\">interest</span>, so it’s an inefficient way to store all the money you earned from working hard. Other options include a savings account or the stock market!",
                "Money in a savings account is more accessible than the money in a stock market. The money in your savings account should not be for everyday purchases, but for emergency funds, vacations, etc. The better thing about savings accounts compared to checking accounts is that it earns you interest on the money you store! Savings accounts usually give you around a 0.5% interest rate, which may seem very little, but its much more than a checking account! If you want a more intensified savings account, put your money in a high yield savings account. High yield savings accounts are better versions of a savings account because it has an interest rate that’s usually 20-30 times higher than the national average rate for savings accounts. The reason why these high yield savings accounts have much higher interest rates than normal savings accounts is that most of them are virtual, so they don’t have physical operating costs. Now you may be wondering: then I can just put all my money into a savings or high yield savings account rather than a checking account and earn more interest right? The answer is no, because savings accounts have limits to how often you can withdraw money. So it is not the best choice for everyday purchases.",
                "You may be reading this and wondering… Why do I even need to care about putting my money into these specific places? Well, you may be a billionaire and never have to worry about storing money in certain places, but all of these billionaires that you know BECAME billionaires by saving and investing their money intelligently. Most Americans don’t save their money at all. In fact, 69% of Americans have less than $1000 in their savings account, and 54.3% of Americans aged 45-54 have no savings at all. To avoid living paycheck to paycheck when you become an adult, you must learn to store and save your money efficiently starting NOW! You don’t want to be in constant worry trying to figure out who to borrow money from next, where you’ll get your next meal, if your landlord will let you slide with the rent one more time!... Or do you?"
